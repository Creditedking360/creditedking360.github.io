  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>Hello! My name is Nicholas, and I am from Petersburg, West Virginia but currently reside in Morgantown, West Virginia. I am a recent May 2020 graduate of West Virginia University and I hold both a Bachelor of Arts and a Master of Arts in Secondary Education/Social Studies. I ended my graduate program at WVU with a 4.0 cumulative GPA. 
Although I am certified to teach Social Studies, after graduating I obtained a position at South Middle School  in Morgantown, WV teaching gifted education with 6th and 7th graders. This position piqued my interest due to my passion for multiple subject areas. Teaching gifted allows me to share my general love of learning with students through discussion, project-based learning, and other varying forms of teaching. My goals are to guide my students to think independently, think far outside of the box, understand their emotions (especially with online education), and create a work ethic so that they can understand the work that they need to do to achieve their goals.</p>
