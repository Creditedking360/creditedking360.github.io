  <p>It is as if each year my philosophy changes after I interact with more student needs. First of all, I believe that without a positive relationship with the students nothing can be accomplished. I also believe that the students need to think on higher levels of Bloom's Taxonomy in order to honestly understand what they are being taught. I want my students to be researchers in my classroom. I want my students to question everything as well, so that in their futures they might be able to solve problems with ideas that we could have never imagined. In general, I am shaping the learners in my classroom to be the leaders of the future.</p>
